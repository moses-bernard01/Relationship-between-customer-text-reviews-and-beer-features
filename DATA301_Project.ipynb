This one is from last night, sealed tightly in the fridge.\\t\\tAppearance- Even on a rough pour, the head barely nudges its way to the surface. A bubbly o-ring of suds lines the outside edge of the beer, popping sporadically over several minutes. The color is a deep, reddish chestnut that showcases some of the malts and I'm sure the pumpkin puree.

I get more apples than pumpkin, though that is present if you search for it, and a hint of spices.

This may have been a mistake. \\t\\t\\tThough I had other reasons to visit Ashland, its disappointing (to say the least) to travel 300 miles and be served a spoiled beer. Both the Oatmeal Stout and Ashland Amber were of poor quality at the Ashland Creek Bar and Grill. In the case of the Oatmeal Stout, a nice measure of cream and a wayward thread of mint were marred by a sulfuric smell and likely bacterial infection. Though I cant say for certain, my best guess is that the house tap lines were something other than sanitized. \\t\\t\\tI will attempt to revisit and re-evaluate this beer. But for the time being, its important to ask a pertinent question about quality control. Caldera is a 10 bbl microbrewery in a small town. How much responsibility do they have towards assuring that taps serving their product in their hometown are kept reasonably clean and free of bacterial encroachment? My answer to this question is that the brewery does have some responsibility to assure quality pours in its own hometown. This is especially so when they operate no pub of their own. Not only does this effort protect the consumer from being served a spoiled beer, but the enforcement of quality control measures at the point of consumption simply makes good business sense. \\t\\t\\tTill then, theres nothing I really care say about this beer other than to wish whoever pursues it greater luck than I had at Ashland Creek.\"},\n",
